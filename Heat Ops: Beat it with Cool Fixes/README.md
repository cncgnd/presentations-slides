## Event Details

- **Event Name:** Heat Ops: Beat it with Cool Fixes
- **Event Date:** 18-05-2024
- **Event Description:** [CNCG New Delhi](https://community.cncf.io/new-delhi/) x [Devtron](https://devtron.ai/) hosted an engaging meetup where they explored the "Oops!" and heated moments experienced by professionals in DevOps, Cloud, and SRE roles. As the summer heated up, so did their systems and processes, and they were there to share how to cool things down. The panel featured a diverse group of experts, from developers to CXOs, who navigated through tricky technical challenges. They shared their personal stories of mishaps, how these experiences affected their work at different levels, and the lessons learned to better standardize processes and minimize future mishaps.
