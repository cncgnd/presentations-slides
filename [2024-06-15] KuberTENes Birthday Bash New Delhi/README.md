He'll explore its early stages as simple building blocks, akin to Lego (v1.0 - v1.19), through to adding exciting features like CRDs and JSON Patch (v1.20 - v1.25), to its current robust state with Gateway API and Service Mesh (v1.26 onwards). We'll also demystify the upgrade process, comparing it to introducing new toys, arranging playtimes, and ensuring favorite toys remain intact.                               |
