| 10:35 AM | Secure Multi-Tenancy with vCluster and Falco: Enhancing Kubernetes Security and Isolation | Saiyam Pathak &nbsp;[ùïè](https://x.com/SaiyamPathak)&nbsp;[![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saiyampathak/) | In this session, we will explore the use of vCluster to achieve robust tenant isolation by creating separate virtual clusters, ensuring logical separation in shared Kubernetes environments. Additionally, we will delve into Falco, an open-source runtime security tool designed to detect real-time threats and suspicious activities in Kubernetes, such as privilege escalations and unauthorized access. This session will highlight best practices for integrating vCluster and Falco to enhance both isolation and threat detection in multi-tenant environments. Attendees will gain actionable insights into building a secure, scalable Kubernetes infrastructure using these tools. Session Takeaways: 1. Tenant Isolation with vCluster: Learn how vCluster enables strong tenant isolation through the creation of distinct virtual clusters. 2.

| 12:00 PM | Patch It Up: Real-Time Vulnerability Management with Kyverno and KubeArmor                | Barun Acharya &nbsp;[ùïè](https://x.com/daemon1024)&nbsp;[![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barun-acharya/)  | In this session, we will explore how organizations can go beyond traditional security best practices, such as using Admission Controllers like Kyverno and Static Analysis tools, to protect against emerging vulnerabilities. While effective, these measures may not always safeguard applications against newly discovered threats. Since application upgrades can take time, it can be more practical to sandbox these vulnerabilities rather than wait for upstream fixes. We will dive into the concept of virtual patching‚Äîan approach to contain and prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities at runtime without affecting application behaviour or deployment processes, thereby preventing downtime. Session Highlights: 1. Addressing Future Vulnerabilities: Learn why static analysis and admission controls may fall short in protecting against new threats. 2. Virtual Patching: Understand how virtual patching can help contain vulnerabilities without impacting applications. 3. Live Demonstrations: Explore real-world examples using well-known vulnerabilities, such as Log4j, PwnKit, xz, and Leaky Vessels. 4. Kyverno and KubeArmor Integration: See how to use Kyverno to identify vulnerable workloads, leverage image vulnerability scanners, and create KubeArmor policies for applying virtual patches, ensuring robust security without operational disruption. |
